## XRNs-DegradomeAnalysis

##### GuitarPlotFast.R  
Degradome signals density among mRNAs are calculated by Modified Guitar.Some functions of Guitar are modified from source code v2.10.0

##### FLEP-Seq_polyAEnds.R  
To find reads of FLEP-Seq containing poly A and then assign 3' ends of alignemnts to non-reference A site.  
Bam files in dataset/Bam_FLEP_seq only contain three genes("AT4G27440","AT1G12090","AT1G15690").

##### FLEP-Seq_PolyAsite-GenomeToTranscriptCoordinates.R  
To correct position of published polyA sites and convert them from genome coordinates to transcript coordinates

##### Reference files:  
TAIR10_representative_gene_models.txt is download from TAIR10 database  
TAIR10_GFF3_genes_transposons.gtf is coverted from TAIR10_GFF3_genes_transposons.gff by gffread.
