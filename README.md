## XRNs-DegradomeAnalysis

##### GuitarPlotFast.R  
Degradome signals density among mRNAs are calculated by Modified Guitar.Some functions of Guitar are modified from source code v2.10.0 by Bo-Han Hou

##### FLEP-Seq_polyAEnds.R  
To find reads containing polyA and then assign ends to non-ref A site.

##### FLEP-Seq_PolyAsite-GenomeToTranscriptCoordinates.R  
To correct position of published polyA sites and convert them from genome coordinates to transcript coordinates

##### Reference files:  
TAIR10_representative_gene_models.txt is download from TAIR10 database  
TAIR10_GFF3_genes_transposons.gtf is coverted from TAIR10_GFF3_genes_transposons.gff by gffread.
